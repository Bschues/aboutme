    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I grew up about 30 minutes north of Indianapolis in a growing town called Fishers. I lived there for almost 20 years before moving to Muncie for college.
            I have since moved to Indianapolis to pursue a career in coding. Technology has always been a major part of my life and I thought it'd be better to get with it than to be left behind.
